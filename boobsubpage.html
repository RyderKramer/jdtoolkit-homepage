<p> Boob was a flyer I had made in Premier. After watching a documentary and witnessing free the nipples in New York, I found it to be the first thing to come to mind when told to make a flyer. Free the nip was started by a group of femminists who found it unfair that men are permitted to parade around shirtless, whereas women face consequences of indecency. After a persistent and consistent fight, women were no longer prohibited from being bare chested. In nicer weather, ladies lounge on towels and benches shirtless, all thanks to free the nips.<p>
