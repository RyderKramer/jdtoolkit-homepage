<p> An assignment for Journalism and Design Toolkit was to take class time to venture out of the classroom, and take photos. Class is located on the 6th floor of The New School's 16th street building, located between fifth avenue and Union Square West. I walked up the buildings steps to the 8th floor where the Ocafe is located. On display and for purchase were a bowl of bananas which I photographed. After the banana photoshoot, I uploaded the image to photoshop where I played with colors and textures of the image. A photo of yellow bananas was then transformed to a group of blue bananas and a strong contrast to emphasize the shadows and lighten the areas where light was more present.<p>
